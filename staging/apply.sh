The executor writes that text after reading untrusted issue bodies and diffs all night, so a session that failed saying its limit resets in a few minutes was waited on and relaunched without bound, and one naming a reset days away ended the night."
        "A limit is now read only from what the CLI writes: the envelope's api_error_status, an error kind field and a reset key, and stderr's error kind and reset. The result and each refused call's input, whose tool_input the executor writes, are skipped when the envelope's fields are walked. LIMIT_PHRASES goes, since nothing reads it. A limit named only in the executor's text is now a crash, relaunched once and then handed back, as any other crash is."
        "The cost: no real limit has been seen yet, so a real one that shows only in the result text is now handed back after two sessions instead of waited out. That fails towards a lost group rather than a lost night."
        "Three cases failed before and pass after: a limit and a near reset in the result text or bare stdout, a kind and a reset inside a refused call's input, and bare stdout naming a limit. The limit cases that read the reset from text now carry it on stderr or in a structured field, and hold on both sides.") ;;
